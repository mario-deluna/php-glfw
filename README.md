## What is this extension? Features ðŸš€

PHP-GLFW aims to be a complete solution containing everything you need to start building graphical applications in PHP. It doesn't just provide **GLFW library bindings**, but also includes **OpenGL bindings** and a set of essential classes and helpers.

### OpenGL

* Full native support for **OpenGL** (4.1+ core), bringing GPU-accelerated rendering to PHP.
* Targets OpenGL 4.1, but can be built for newer versions as well.
* Support for OpenGL extensions (limited).
* Mirrors the C API as closely as possible, with adjustments made where required or otherwise nonsensical.
* Supports ~90% of the full standard; see [GLSUPPORT.md](./GLSUPPORT.md) for details.

### GLFW

This extension includes bindings for the powerful **[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)** library, offering a range of amazing features, such as:

* Multiplatform Window creation and handling (MacOS / Windows / Linux)
* Support for multiple windows and monitors
* Real-time user input handling
  * **Keyboard and Mouse** event handling
  * **Joystick** input support

### PHPGL - Math

PHP-GLFW comes with a built-in mathematics library, written in C and optimized for graphical applications.

* Supported structs: `Vec2`, `Vec3`, `Vec4`, `Mat4`, and `Quat`
* Includes most common matrix operations, like: `lookAt`, `perspective`, `inverse`, `rotate`, and more

Integration into the extension offers several advantages:

* High performance
* Low memory footprint
* Overloaded operators for math structs, enabling intuitive operations like:
  ```php
  use GL\Math\Vec2;
  $v3 = Vec2(15, -5) + Vec2(42, 7); // returns Vec2(57, 2)
  ```
* Some OpenGL functions directly accept math structs as arguments

1. [Read more about math functions](https://phpgl.net/user-guide/math/math_functions.html)

### PHPGL - Buffers

This extension also includes a set of buffer objects that internally hold data in native types.

* Can handle large arrays of data
* Low memory footprint and very fast
* Data is stored internally to be directly uploadable to the GPU

1. [Read more about the buffers](https://phpgl.net/API/Buffer/FloatBuffer.html)

### PHPGL - Textures

PHP-GLFW supports the loading of images/textures into buffers without requiring an additional extension:

* Can load common image formats, like `jpg`, `png`, `tga`, `bmp`, and `gif` _(gd or Imagick is not required)_
* Can write images/textures back to disk
* Writes data into a `BufferInterface` object, providing full access to the bitmap

1. [Read more about texture loading](https://phpgl.net/API/Texture/Texture2D.html)

### PHPGL - Geometry

PHP-GLFW comes with a `.obj` wavefront file loader, allowing you to load and parse `.obj` files. It also provides helpers to generate tangent and bitangent vectors for the loaded geometry. Currently, only triangulated geometry is supported, with no support for quads.

* Can parse `.obj` and `.mtl` files
* Can generate normal, tangent, and bitangent vectors for the loaded geometry on the fly
* Allows extraction of separate meshes and groups from the loaded geometry
* Can group vertices by their material
* Can reindex extracted meshes to reduce the number of vertices

1. [Read more about geometry loading](https://phpgl.net/API/Geometry/ObjFileParser.html)

### How are the bindings achieved?

PHP-GLFW parses the OpenGL specs to generate most of the C extension, instead of porting functions manually. Manual adjustments are made where necessary.

### PHP-Towerdense Game

We are currently developing a 3D game entirely built with PHP, leveraging the power of PHP-GLFW. The game, named PHP-TowerDefense, is open-source and serves as a showcase for the capabilities of PHP-GLFW. Although the game is in active development, it is not yet ready for release.

## Installation 

**Please refer to the comprehensive installation guide here: [Installation](https://phpgl.net/getting-started/installation/install-linux.html)**

> **PHP Version:** `>= 8.0`
> While I would love to support older PHP builds, it was just not feasible for this extension.

### MacOS 

#### Installer

You can use a simple installer script to install PHP-GLFW:

```
php -r "copy('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw/master/install/macos-installer.php', 'phpglfw-installer.php');" && php phpglfw-installer.php
```

Once you see "Installation finished!", you're ready to go!

#### Manual installation

For a manual approach, ensure you have installed the `php-dev`, `git`, and `cmake` packages. **They are required!**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw
cd php-glfw
sudo phpize && ./configure --enable-glfw
sudo make install
```

Don't forget to add `glfw.so` in the `php.ini` file:

```ini
extension="glfw.so"
```

### Linux 

`cmake` is required for the installation. You can skip the first step if it's already installed.
Also, make sure that you install the `php-dev` package, for example, `php8.1-dev`.

```
sudo apt install -y cmake git 
git clone https://github.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw
cd php-glfw
sudo phpize && ./configure --enable-glfw
sudo make install
```

Make sure to add `glfw.so` in the `php.ini` file:

```ini
extension="glfw.so"
```

### Stubs (IDE Support)

As this is a PHP extension, your editor / IDE does not support auto-completion and doc lookups without some help.
We created a composer package you can include as a dev dependency to have full support:

```
composer require --dev phpgl/ide-stubs
```
