# glfwIconifyWindow
Iconifies the specified window.

```php
function glfwIconifyWindow(\GLFWwindow $window) : void
```

This function iconifies (minimizes) the specified window if it was
previously restored. If the window is already iconified, this function does
nothing.

If the specified window is a full screen window, GLFW restores the original
video mode of the monitor. The window's desired video mode is set again
when the window is restored.
