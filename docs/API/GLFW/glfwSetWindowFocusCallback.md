# glfwSetWindowFocusCallback
This function sets the focus callback of the specified window, which is
called when the window gains or loses input focus.

```php
function glfwSetWindowFocusCallback(\GLFWwindow $window, callable $callback) : void
```

After the focus callback is called for a window that lost input focus,
synthetic key and mouse button release events will be generated for all such
that had been pressed.  For more information, see glfwSetKeyCallback and
glfwSetMouseButtonCallback.

Example:
```php
glfwSetWindowFocusCallback($window, function($focused) {
    echo "Window focus changed to: " . $focused . PHP_EOL;
});
```

arguments

:    1. `\GLFWwindow` `$window` The window whose callback to set.
    2. `callable` `$callback` 

returns

:    `void`
