# glShaderSource
Replaces the source code in a shader object.

```php
function glShaderSource(int $shader, string $source) : void
```

PHP-GLFW: As with PHP I don't see a reason to split up the shader source to
multiple addresses.
This is why the function in PHP is simplyfied.

arguments

:    1. `int` `$shader` Specifies the handle of the shader object whose source
    code is to be replaced.
    2. `string` `$source` Specifies a string containing the source code to be
    loaded into the shader.

returns

:    `void`
