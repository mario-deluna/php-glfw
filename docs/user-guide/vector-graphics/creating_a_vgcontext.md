# Getting Started

Before we can start drawing anything, we need to create a window and create a context in which we can draw.

Please see [Creating a Window](./window-creation.md) for more information on how to create a window and a context.

_We are not going to discuss the details of creating a window and a context in this tutorial._

!!! question "PHP-GLFW already installed?"

    Follow the **[installation guide](./installation/install-linux.md)** if you **haven't** installed the extension yet!

You can run this example by `php examples/11_vector_graphics.php`.

## Creating a VG Context

To properly utilize the vector graphics API, we need to create a `VGContext` object. This object will hold all the internal state that the vector graphics state machine needs to operate. (You can have multiple.)

```php
use GL\VectorGraphics\{VGContext};

// code to initalize GLFW and create a window here...

// initalize the a vector graphics context
$vg = new VGContext(VGContext::ANTIALIAS);
```

As you can see the `VGContext` constructor takes flags as an argument. In this example we pass `VGContext::ANTIALIAS` to enable (you gussed it) antialiasing.

The following flags are available:

* `VGContext::ANTIALIAS` - Enables geometry-based anti-aliasing. Useful for smoothing edges in rendering. May not be necessary with multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA).
* `VGContext::STENCIL_STROKES` - Utilizes the stencil buffer for stroke drawing. Ensures correct rendering of path overlaps and sharp turns, with each segment drawn only once. Slightly slower but provides precision.
* `VGContext::DEBUG` - Activates additional debug checks. Helpful for development and troubleshooting.

## Beginnig and ending a frame

In your application's render loop you need to call `beginFrame()` and `endFrame()` on the `VGContext` object. The context will queue all draw commands until you call `endFrame()`. 

=== "Basic"

    ```php
    $vg->beginFrame($width, $height, $devicePixelRatio);
    
    // draw stuff here...

    $vg->endFrame();
    ```

=== "Full Example"

    ```php hl_lines="23 32 33 34 35 36 37"
    use GL\VectorGraphics\VGContext;

    if (!glfwInit()) {
        throw new Exception('GLFW could not be initialized!');
    }

    // make sure to set the GLFW context version to the same 
    // version the GLFW extension has been compiled with, default 4.1
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 4);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 1);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);

    // Create a window 
    if (!$window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "PHP GLFW Demo")) {
        throw new Exception('OS Window could not be initialized!');
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent($window);
    glfwSwapInterval(1);

    // initalize the a vector graphics context
    $vg = new VGContext(VGContext::ANTIALIAS);

    // Main Loop
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose($window))
    {
        glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        // start a new vector graphics frame
        $vg->beginFrame(800, 600, 1);

        // DRAW STUFF HERE...
        
        // end the frame will dispatch all the draw commands to the GPU
        $vg->endFrame();

        // swap the windows framebuffer and
        // poll queued window events.
        glfwSwapBuffers($window);
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow($window);
    glfwTerminate();

    ```


The `beginFrame()` method takes 3 arguments:

* `width` - The width of the window in points. This will almost always be the same as the width of your window.
* `height` - The height of the window in points. Just like the width, this will almost always be the same as the height of your window.
* `devicePixelRatio` - The ratio between the window's backing pixels and the window's points. This is usually `1.0` on normal displays and `2.0` on retina displays.
 You can find out the device pixel ratio of your window by calling `glfwGetWindowContentScale()`.
    ```php
    glfwGetWindowContentScale($window, $scaleX, $scaleY);
    glfwGetWindowSize($window, $windowWidth, $windowHeight);
    $vg->beginFrame($windowWidth, $windowHeight, $scaleX);
    ```

## Drawing

Now that we have a context and a frame, we can start drawing. The vector graphics API is very similar to the HTML Canvas API. If you have ever used the HTML Canvas API, you will feel right at home.

The first thing we need to do is create a path. A path is a collection of points, lines, curves and shapes. We can then stroke or fill the path to draw it to the screen.

```php
$vg->beginPath();
```

Now that we have a path, we can start drawing shapes. The vector graphics API provides a few methods to draw basic shapes.

```php
// rect(x, y, width, height)
$vg->rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
```

To set the color of a shape, we can use the `fillColor()` and `strokeColor()` methods.

The `VGColor` class provides a few static methods to create colors from a basic palette.

```php
// set the fill color to red
$vg->fillColor(VGColor::red());
```

To fill a shape, we can use the `fill()` method. To stroke a shape, we can use the `stroke()` method.

```php
// fill the shape with the current fill color
$vg->fill();
```

### Putting it all together

All together, this is how you would draw a red rectangle to the screen.

<figure markdown>
  ![PHP VectorGraphics Rectangle Drawing](./../../docs-assets/php-glfw/user_guide/vg/context_creation/rect.png){ width="700" }
</figure>


=== "Basic"

    ```php
    $vg->beginPath();
    $vg->rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
    $vg->fillColor(VGColor::red());
    $vg->fill();
    ```

=== "Full Example"

    ```php
    use GL\VectorGraphics\VGColor;
    use GL\VectorGraphics\VGContext;

    if (!glfwInit()) {
        throw new Exception('GLFW could not be initialized!');
    }

    // make sure to set the GLFW context version to the same 
    // version the GLFW extension has been compiled with, default 4.1
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 4);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 1);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);

    // Create a window 
    if (!$window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "PHP GLFW Demo")) {
        throw new Exception('OS Window could not be initialized!');
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent($window);
    glfwSwapInterval(1);

    // initalize the a vector graphics context
    $vg = new VGContext(VGContext::ANTIALIAS);

    // Main Loop
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose($window))
    {
        glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        // start a new vector graphics frame
        $vg->beginFrame(800, 600, 1);

        $vg->beginPath();
        $vg->rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
        $vg->fillColor(VGColor::red());
        $vg->fill();

        // end the frame will dispatch all the draw commands to the GPU
        $vg->endFrame();

        glfwSwapBuffers($window);
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow($window);
    glfwTerminate();
    ```

## Adding some interaction

To not end this "Getting Started" tutorial with a static image, let's add some interaction to our example. We are going to draw a circle that follows the mouse cursor.

To get the mouse position, we can use the `glfwGetCursorPos()` function.

```php
glfwGetCursorPos($window, $mouseX, $mouseY);
```

Then we just replace our call to `rect()` with a call to `circle()` and use the mouse position as the center of the circle.

```php
$vg->beginPath();
$vg->circle($mouseX, $mouseY, 50);
$vg->fillColor(VGColor::red());
$vg->fill();
```

As simple as that, we now have a circle that follows the mouse cursor.
