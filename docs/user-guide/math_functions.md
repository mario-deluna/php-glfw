# Math Functions 


!!! warning

    There currently is a "bug" in the zend engine where multiplication operands are switched in 
    some expressions. This is a problem when multiplying matrices as the order / sequence there is cricitcal 
    compared to normal multiplications...
    
    To workaround this you have to set paranthesis to enforce the correct order.
