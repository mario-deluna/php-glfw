# Basic triangle

This is the most basic example of how to use the GLFW library. You can think of it as a "Hello World" example. In this example, we create a window and render a triangle.

This example does not utilize our helper class to keep it as basic as possible.

<figure markdown>
  ![A triangle drawn with OpenGL in PHP](./../../docs-assets/php-glfw/examples/01-triangle.png){ width="400" }
  <figcaption>A triangle drawn with OpenGL in PHP</figcaption>
</figure>


<div style="text-align: center;" markdown>
[Check out the Code](https://github.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw/blob/master/examples/01_triangle.php){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
</div>

Run this example:

```
