# Gettings Started with PHP & OpenGL 

This getting started guide is not specifically just about PHP-GLFW. I also try to explain some basics about OpenGL and how to use it with PHP.
So see this more as a Tutorial to learn OpenGL with PHP. Or an OpenGL crash course in PHP.

## What is OpenGL?

OpenGL is a cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It is used in many applications, including games, CAD, and scientific visualization. OpenGL is designed as a state machine, meaning it has a set of global states that define how it should render graphics. If you come from an OOP background, this will seem a bit strange and will take some time to get used to and lure you into some very frustrating bugs. But once you get the hang of it, it is a very powerful and flexible API.

## Additional resources 

I took a lot of inspiration from multiple sources to write this tutorial. Especially the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) website was a great help and went into much more detail than I could for PHP-GLFW. I highly recommend you check it out, as most things are directly applicable to PHP-GLFW.
