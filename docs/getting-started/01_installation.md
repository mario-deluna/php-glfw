# Installation

## Installing PHP-GLFW

### Linux 

###Â MacOS

To make the installation on MacOS as painless as possible we provide an installer script that in most scenarios installs the extension in a one liner. 

#### Installer

Run the following command to download and execute the installer, **Having PHP installed locally is required for this!**

```
php -r "copy('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw/master/install/macos-installer.php', 'phpglfw-installer.php');" && sudo php phpglfw-installer.php
```

Thats it, if you see the text "Installation finished!" you should be ready to go!

#### Manual installation

If you prefer a "manual" approach, ensure you have installed the `php-dev`, `git` and `cmake` packages. **They are required!**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mario-deluna/php-glfw
cd php-glfw
```

Configure and build the extension

```bash
sudo phpize && ./configure --enable-glfw
sudo make install
```

make sure to add `glfw.so` in the `php.ini` file.

You can figure out the path to your php.ini file using:

```bash
php -i | grep php.ini
```

Edit that file using you favorite editor:

```bash
sudo vim /usr/local/etc/php/8.1/php.ini
```

And add the following line at the end of the file

```ini
extension="glfw.so"
```

### Windows

PHP-GLFW will not run properly under WSL (Windows Subsystem) so make sure you install PHP nativley to windows. If you already done so you can skip the next section.

#### Install PHP

1. Go to https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.1 and download a x64 thread safe version of PHP.
2. Extract the zip file and move the contents to `C:\php`. (You have to create that directory)
3. Ensure this path is valid now, and points to an executable: `C:\php\php.exe`.
4. Add `C:\php` to the `Path` environment variable. 
    1. Press on windows start and search for environment.
    2. "Edit the system environment variables" should popup, open it.
    3. In the dialog, click on the tab "Advanced" and then on the button "Environment Variables..."
    4. In the "System Variables" list scroll down and edit the `Path` variable.
    5. In the edit dialog, click on the "New" and enter `C:\php`.
5. Open up a **NEW** powershell or CMD and type `php -v` to verify the installation.

#### Download DLL

---

#### Build from Source

In order to build PHP-GLFW we need to the "Development Package".

1. Go to https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.1 and download the x64 thread safe "Development package (SDK to develop PHP extensions)".
2. Place the contents of the downloaded zip into `C:\php`. **If that directory does not exist, please follow the steps "Install PHP"**.
3. Follow the following guide https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2.
4. In the `php-sdk` directory run the following:
    1. run one of the `bat` files for your setup. I used: `phpsdk-vs17-x64.bat`.
    1. phpsdk_deps --update --branch master
    3. Copy PHP-GLFW source into `ext/glfw` of the cloned PHP source code.
5. run: `buildconf && configure --disable-all --enable-cli --enable-glfw=shared && nmake`


#### Install Dev Package



#### Install the extension

Now we can finally build the actual extension.

1. Download or clone PHP-GLFW and open the directory up in a power shell or CMD.
2. run `phpize`
3. run `./configure --enable-glfw`
