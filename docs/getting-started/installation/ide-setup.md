# PHP-GLFW IDE Setup 

## Stubs

Since PHP-GLFW is a PHP extension, your editor / IDE may not support auto-completion and doc lookups without some help.
To address this, we have created a composer package that you can include as a dev dependency to have full support:

```bash
composer require --dev phpgl/ide-stubs
```
